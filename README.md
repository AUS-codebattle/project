## Aim 🎯:
- Our goal was to accomplish one of the SDG goals through the medium of a website.
- We decided to choose the SDG 3 goal on health and make a website that would cater to your daily health needs.
- We used the HTML, CSS and JS knowledge that we had to come up with a handy website that would encourage healthy living.
## Features 🌟: 
- This website has a checklist which tells you what you're supposed to do daily, like brushing, eating regular meals, bathing etc.
- This website also has a local "Hospitals Near Me" map that informs the user about the closest emergency services in case of emergencies.
- This website also provides a list of emergency numbers on a seperate page to keep them handy.
